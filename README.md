# The Impact of a Genetic Algorithm System on Solving VigenÃ¨re Ciphered Strings

## Overview
This project covers the findings and process of implementing a Genetic Algorithm to find the password used to encrypt some text using the Vigenere Cipher Crypto System.
## What Does This Project Consist Of?
1. **A Research Report:** *Karanjot Pabla - GA Report.pdf*  

2. **A Java Program File:** *GeneticAlgs.java*  
This program outlines and demonstrates a simple genetic algorithm (GA), generating the fittest solution (password) given the size of the solution (chromosome size), encrypted piece of text, and various defined parameters for the GA; evaluated using a defined evaluation function.

## How to Run the Program?
To Run the Genetic Algorithm Program (*GeneticAlgs.java*), open the Java file in your favorite IDE, and RUN it ðŸ˜Š
